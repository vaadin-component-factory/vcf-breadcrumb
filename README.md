## Updates since version 2.0.0

- Lit based component with theming support.
- The first item in the breadcrumb is always shown in full.
- The items can be collapsed when space runs out. This is configurable by using the attribute `collapse`. When availabe space is not enough to display the full label, then the label is shown with ellipsis.
- If space is even more limited, and some breadcrumbs have the `collapse` attribute:
    - Consecutive collapsed items are grouped into ranges.
    - Each range is hidden when necessary and replaced with an ellipsis element.
- `shift` attribute from previous version was removed. Responsive behavior is now given by the `collapse` attribute implementation.

### Customize separators

By default, there are few css variables that help you update the separator's style:

| CSS Variable | Definition | Default value |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-font-family | Font family of the separator icon | lumo-icons |
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-symbol | Separator icon | var(--lumo-icons-angle-right) |
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-color | Color of the separator icon | var(--lumo-contrast-40pct) |
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-size | Size of the separator icon | var(--lumo-font-size-s) |  
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-margin | Margin of the separator icon | 0 |    
| --vcf-breadcrumb-separator-padding | Padding of the separator icon | 0 var(--lumo-space-xs) |    

## Updates since version 2.2.0

Added support for [Mobile Mode](https://github.com/vaadin-component-factory/vcf-breadcrumb/issues/6). It can be triggered in two ways:
- Based on a fixed breakpoint (same as other Vaadin components): `(max-width: 450px), (max-height: 450px)` or
- Programmatically, using the flag `forceMobileMode`, which allows to enable mobile layout manually

When in Mobile Mode, Breadcrumbs are styled for mobile navigation showing only back path.
- Shows the last breadcrumb unless it's the current one
- Shows the breadcrumb directly before the current one

![breadcrumbs-mobile-mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c555264-944a-4134-83d2-6b47e0c32610)

By default, mobile mode shows a back icon that can be customized using the CSS variable: `--vcf-breadcrumb-mobile-back-symbol`
